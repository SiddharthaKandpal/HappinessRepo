# Happiness Report Analysis

## Introduction

The World Happiness Report is an annual publication by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It measures the happiness levels of people in different countries around the world based on various factors such as social support, income, freedom, trust, generosity, and health.

This project is for the in-depth analysis of the World Happiness Report from 2015-2019.

## Objective
The objective of this dataset project is to analyze the factors that contribute to happiness in different countries around the world using the 2019 State of World Happiness dataset. This involves exploring the dataset, identifying patterns and relationships between the variables, cleaning the data, preprocessing the data, and training a model to predict the happiness score based on the input variables.

The ultimate goal is to identify the most important factors that contribute to happiness and provide insights into how countries can improve the well-being of their citizens. This project can help policymakers, researchers, and organizations understand the factors that contribute to happiness and develop strategies to improve the quality of life in different countries.

## Data

## Plan
This would be my plan of actions that i would take to reach my objective.
1) Data Exploration: Start by exploring the dataset to get a better understanding of the variables, their data types, missing values, and the relationships between the variables. You can use libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to load and manipulate the dataset. Some of the questions to answer in this step are:
a) What are the variables in the dataset?
b) What are the data types of each variable?
c) Are there any missing values? If yes, how will you handle them?
d) What are the ranges of values for each variable?
e) Are there any correlations between variables?

2) Data Cleaning: Once you have a good understanding of the dataset, you can start cleaning the data. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicate entries, and dealing with outliers. You may also need to convert some variables to different data types, such as categorical variables.

3) Data Visualization: Visualize the dataset to identify trends and patterns in the data. You can use libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

4) Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for modeling by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables. You can use libraries such as Scikit-learn to perform these tasks.

5) Model Selection: Choose an appropriate model to predict the gender equality index. Some of the models you can use include linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and neural networks.

6) Model Training: Train the chosen model on the training dataset and tune the hyperparameters to optimize its performance.
